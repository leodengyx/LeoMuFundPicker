Synopsis
========

Code Example

Motivation
==========
The reason why I start this project is that I am done with the Mutual Fund Representative to help to decide
what kind of Mutual Fund to purchase, because I found they are just bullshit.
And i want to do some useful Python project to practice coding. From this project I learn how to use urllib2, BeautifulSoup,
click, openpyxl Python libraries.
